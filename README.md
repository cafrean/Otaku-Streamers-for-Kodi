# Otaku-Streamers for Kodi 


## Description
A video add-on for Kodi (kodi.tv) that enables streaming from Otaku-Streamers (otaku-streamers.com).

## Usage
This add-on requires an account on Otaku-Streamers. Once you are registered, and the add-on is installed, enter your credentials in the Add-on settings to begin using it. 

## Installation
The installation process is a bit convoluted at this early stage. I will try and make a link available
for downloading a prepared .zip-file in the near future, to make it a bit easier.

### Prepare the zip file
1. Download the repository as a zip file.
2. Extract the downloaded file.
3. Navigate to the folder named "plugin.video.otaku-streamers".
4. Create a new zip file containing *only* the folder mentioned above.
5. Ensure that the name of the new file is "plugin.video.otaku-streamers.zip".

### Install in Kodi
1. Navigate to "System" -> "Add-ons".
2. Select "Install from zip file".
3. Navigate to where you put your zip file.
4. Select it and press OK.
